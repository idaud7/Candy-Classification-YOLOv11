# Candy-Classification-YOLOv11

A focused Python project that:

- **Loads & inspects** the Candy dataset (features like chocolate, fruity, caramel, sugar percent, price, etc.)  
- **Preprocesses** data (handling missing values, scaling numeric features, encoding categorical variables)  
- **Splits** into training and test sets for robust evaluation  
- **Trains & tunes** multiple classifiers (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)  
- **Evaluates** models with accuracy, precision/recall, and confusion matrices  
- **Provides** a Jupyter notebook showcasing EDA, feature importance analysis, model comparison, and final predictions
